## Learning Journey 

### Webpack and Modular Coding
 
Initially, I found it challenging to adapt to modular coding practices. Understanding how to break down the application into various modules and organizing them effectively was a steep learning curve.

Working with Webpack had its own set of challenges. Configuring Webpack and understanding its different plugins and loaders were initial roadblocks. I even had to restart the project from scratch at one point, which was a humbling experience but also served as an intense learning period.

The process has been rewarding, as I've gained a deep understanding of modular programming and how to use Webpack efficiently for building my projects.
